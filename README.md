blender_procedural_buildings
============================

Python for creating a set of buildings in blender

There are a range of files in the package, but to use the package in its current form you need to:

1. Open the blender file base_components.blend
2. Open a text editor window and load the procedural_buildings.py file
3. Run the python script to generate the buildings
4. Add a camera in the appropriate location
5. Add layer two (skydome) and render

Layer 20 contains the models used in the generator so modifying the windows and roof component will produce different types of building
